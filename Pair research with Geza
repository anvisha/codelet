Pair research with Geza

(1) Map out import statements
Python: syntax is a small part of it
Better mileage in mapping knowledge of APIs.
consider -methods- rather than syntax
eg import statements/module names
method names/objects
also generalizable across languages
https://pypi.python.org/pypi

another benefit: broader target audience?

+ libraries have dependence between each other

(2) Higher-level 

Vocabulary vs Grammar
Syntax, OOO etc is all grammar
the objects,methods,apis is vocabulary

BUT this depends on the application

(3) How would we verify this? Metrics

- point them to  a codebase they've never seen before, ask them to mark the concepts that they understand and not - or small quizzes. or mark the parts that you don't understand.
