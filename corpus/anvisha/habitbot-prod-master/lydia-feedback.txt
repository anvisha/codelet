need an example to start
sign in happens first
sign up is not clear
thanks is blank
punishment: "if i don't do it, what my twitter followers will see"
didn't read explanation
displays time locally
hashtag isn't in the thing
check for 'to' and delete it
check for punctuation at the end of the goal
home doesn't link to home

must be way more visual
didn't read explanation at all
flow chart
unclear what actually gets tweeted
use the cat to tie that together

don't know when this is supposed to stop 
maybe set end points?
