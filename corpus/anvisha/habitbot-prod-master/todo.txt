0. fixes to things lydia pointed out. usability in signup.
1. form validation, i think
2. make invite flow buttons better
3. alignment of form fields (timepicker, and anything prepended)
4. test backend stuff



base.html
=========
This has the navbar and footer only. Everything gets filled into 'filler' which is in a container.

if_in.html
==========
This should just be empty. Gives room for content only. You can include herounit.html and explain.html on your own if you want them. This is a translator so I don't have to change things anywhere.

auth_only.html
==============
This should be hero & explain, along with an alert explaining. Then the appropriate buttons to follow invite flow.

if_out.html
=========== 
This should be hero & explain, along with an alert explaining? Maybe? Then invite flow buttons.
